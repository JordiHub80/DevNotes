## Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation and Variables

### Printing

Type the word print followed by two parentheses with quotation marks to tell the console what to print. 

**Strings** are pieces of text shown as a "string" of characters. The quotation marks show the beginning and ending of a string.

**Syntax Highlighting** refers to the color of the code that changes depending on its current function. 

In python, one is expected to end their code with a **new line**, basically just an extra line after the last line of code. 

### String Manipulation

To create a new line inside a print function, type **\n** followed by the following text.
Ex. print("Hello world!\nHello world!\nHello world!")

**String Concatenation** adds two strings together using the command 
Ex. print("Hello" + "Jordi")

**Input function** asks a prompt for the user. 

**Comments** in Python are marked by a #
